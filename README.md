# heartbeat
Cute reminder application

TODO:

- Be able to add more than one heart to the screen and be able to scale heart sizes. 
- For each heart added, get user input on the date they'd like to remember and the name of that date. Display this on the heart.
- For any change made on the screen, have a save button appear. This will print changes to the cookie. 
- Have the heart beat faster as that date approaches. 
- Cookie tracking: for each heart, record last saved position on page and its date info (prelim: print out coords to screen in real time).
